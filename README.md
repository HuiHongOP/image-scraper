# Drop Image Feature

## Why is this feature created?
The feature is created to speed up the bulk upload for images on dropbox links instead of going through each provided dropbox image links.


## What is database is being used here?
I used PostgreSQL as the database to store the information. This is being hosted on Heroku.


## How does it work? 
Step 1: Click on the "Download Format Sheet". It would download the excel file for you

Step 3: Fill all the "Image1" to "Image10" if you need to. Those are the dropbox links that you wanted to extract out the image url. Leave the highlighted in green blank. Those are the image urls that your going to get after extraction.
Look at the final result for excel.

Step 5: Download into CSV file format. You are going to get a final excel file with "imageurl1" to "imageurl10" filled accordingly to your "Image1" to "Image10"

As you see the final result of that one dropbox url.

Now you can just bulk those image urls.
