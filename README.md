# Drop Image Feature

## Why is this feature created?
The feature is created to speed up the bulk upload for images on dropbox links instead of going through each provided dropbox image links.

## How does it work? 
Step 1: Click on the "Download Format Sheet". It would download the excel file for you

Step 2: Fill in the Excel accordingly. As for the getting the Xpath, see the below image: 
    You just need one Xpath into the excel B2 cell


Step 3: Fill all the "Image1" to "Image10" if you need to. Those are the dropbox links that you wanted to extract out the image url. Leave the highlighted in green blank. Those are the image urls that your going to get after extraction.
Look at the final result for excel.

Step 4: Click on "Choose File", select the correct file and click "Submit". Wait for a little
After your excel file is fully processed. Click on "Click here for the data!" to get the final excel file.

Step 5: Download into CSV file format. You are going to get a final excel file with "imageurl1" to "imageurl10" filled accordingly to your "Image1" to "Image10"

As you see the final result of that one dropbox url.
